# Technologies Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the key networking technologies covered in the lab. These technologies form the foundation of modern enterprise networks, enabling robust connectivity, security, and automation. Each technology is briefly described below to highlight its role and significance in the lab exercises.

## Core Technologies

- **Switching**  
  Fundamental Layer 2 technology for connecting devices within a LAN, enabling VLAN segmentation, port-channel configurations, and efficient traffic forwarding.

- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**  
  Automates IP address assignment to devices, streamlining network configuration and management for hosts.

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**  
  A Cisco proprietary advanced distance-vector routing protocol, optimized for fast convergence and efficient routing within enterprise networks.

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**  
  A link-state routing protocol used for dynamic routing in IP networks, supporting scalable and hierarchical network designs.

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**  
  The protocol for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems, critical for inter-domain routing and MPLS VPNs.

- **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**  
  A high-performance technology for directing data across networks using labels, enhancing scalability and traffic engineering.

- **MPLS L3VPN (Layer 3 Virtual Private Network)**  
  Provides secure, scalable Layer 3 connectivity between sites over an MPLS network, ideal for enterprise WAN deployments.

- **LDP (Label Distribution Protocol)**  
  Facilitates the distribution of MPLS labels, enabling routers to establish label-switched paths for efficient data forwarding.

- **DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network)**  
  A scalable VPN solution that supports dynamic, secure connectivity between sites using hub-and-spoke or spoke-to-spoke topologies.

- **Redistribution**  
  The process of sharing routing information between different routing protocols to ensure seamless network connectivity.

- **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)**  
  A Cisco protocol providing gateway redundancy to ensure high availability for network hosts.

- **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**  
  Secures IP communications by authenticating and encrypting data, commonly used in VPNs for secure data transmission.

- **SDWAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network)**  
  A software-based approach to managing WANs, offering centralized control, dynamic path selection, and policy-driven traffic management.

- **SDA (Software-Defined Access)**  
  A Cisco solution for automating and securing network access, leveraging intent-based networking and segmentation.

- **DNAC (Cisco DNA Center)**  
  A centralized management platform for configuring, monitoring, and automating Cisco DNA-based networks, including SDA deployments.

## Purpose

These technologies are integrated throughout the lab to provide hands-on experience with configuring, troubleshooting, and optimizing modern network environments. Understanding their roles and interactions is essential for mastering the lab objectives and preparing for real-world networking challenges.
